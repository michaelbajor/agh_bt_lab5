# Lab5

Today we take a look at a basic AMM. You will be implementing it most yourself, but you do have some guidelines in there.

The test cases are written and **CANNOT** be changed - everything will pass on a correct implementation. You are welcome to **ADD** your own tests, of course.

Today is not meant to be a huge challenge. The goal is to get more proficient with Solidity while also learning the foundation of Web3 DeFi technology.
